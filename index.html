	<p>Despite a year of progress within the city moving towards a vaccinated New York, Hate Crimes are on the rise in New York City. New York City Police Department (NYPD) data shows that hate crimes have experienced a 58% increase from 2020 to 2021 with 450 hate crimes being reported for the current year as of October 20th, 2021.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, an incident is considered a hate crime when the incident is ” is motivated in whole or substantial part by a person’s, a group’s or a place’s identification with a particular race, color, religion, ethnicity, gender, age, disability, ancestry, national origin or sexual orientation (including gay, lesbian, bi-sexual, and transgender) as determined by the Commanding Officer of the Hate Crime Task Force.”</p>

<p>The community that was targeted the most in New York City were religious groups. Religious hate crimes accounted for more than a quarter of the hate crimes that occurred so far in the year. An overwhelming number of these occurrences targeted the Jewish community. Anti-semitism driven hate crimes have experienced a 20% increase from 2020 to 2021.</p>

<p>Kelli Muse,Chief of the Hate Crimes Bureau in Brooklyn, detailed a few cases of anti-semitism hate crimes she saw this year. Incidents ranged from kids drawing swastikas around their community the night before halloween to a yamaka being knocked off someone's head.</p>

<p>Other identities that were disproportionately impacted by hate crimes include the Asian community. About 164 cases of hate crimes against asian individuals were reported to the NYPD this year. Reports of Asian hate crimes became recurrent throughout the start of the pandemic. The increase in hate crimes targeted towards this group was partially attributed from racially-fueled beliefs regarding COVID-19. Organizations and groups such as the Stop AAPI Hate coalition, noted this relationship and worked alongside this community to accurately report and address this national crisis. Yet a year later, asian hate crimes still are still rampant with the community accounting for the second most frequently targeted group for hate crimes in New York. </p>

<p>Black hate crimes also made up a notable amount of hate crimes occurring this year. Black hate accounted for 8% of hate crimes that occurred this year. However, Deborah Lautner, Executive Director of the Office for the Prevention of Hate Crimes (OPHC), noted that it is possible that the NYPD might be underreporting the amount of hate crimes occurring to this community because of a distrust in law enforcement.</p>

<p>Whatever the targeted community is behind a hate crime, Sergeant Charleston of the NYPD, stresses one thing to the public: report any hate crime immediately to law enforcement.</p>

<p>“It's important to report it as soon as the crime happens. I mean, the quicker we can get the information to us the faster detectives do. Police officers can respond to the scene, gather evidence, interview witnesses, conduct video canvasses and try to bring that perpetrator to justice.”, he said. </p>
